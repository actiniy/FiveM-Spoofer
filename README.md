Overview
This project provides a safe, auditable approach to hardware ID based licensing for legitimate FiveM server deployments and client-side tooling. It emphasizes transparency, user consent, and compliance with applicable laws and game terms. The toolkit helps server admins verify authorized devices, enforce limits, renew licenses, and revoke access when needed.

Core Concepts
- HWID (Hardware ID): A stable identifier derived from hardware components, used to tie licenses to devices.
- Licensing: The process of issuing, binding, renewing, and revoking licenses tied to specific HWIDs.
- Activation: The step where a licensed device is enrolled and granted access to services.
- Revocation: The mechanism to revoke access if terms are breached or a license expires.
- Auditing: Logs and reports that document licensing actions for accountability.

Features
- Device binding and HWID verification
- License issuance, renewal, and revocation workflows
- Local client and server components with clear separation of duties
- Auditable logs with secure storage and tamper resistance
- Cross-platform support (Windows and Linux)
- Simple CLI and optional SDKs for integration
- Clear error handling and user guidance
- Safe defaults that minimize data collection and protect user privacy

Architecture
- Server Component: Manages licenses, binds HWIDs, and issues activation tokens. Stores licenses in a secure, auditable ledger.
- Client Component: Runs on the licensed device, performs HWID verification, and activates access.
- Communication Layer: Secure channels for license requests and status checks.
- Data Layer: Logs and license records stored with integrity checks.
- CLI/SDK: Lightweight interfaces for admins and developers to integrate licensing into workflows.

Getting Started
This project is designed for teams deploying legitimate, consent-based licensing for FiveM mods and servers. It helps operators ensure that only authorized devices can access licensed features and services.

What you will need
- A modern development environment (Linux or Windows)
- A preferred runtime for the server (e.g., Node.js, Python) or a language-agnostic protocol for integration
- Basic familiarity with licensing concepts and HWID concepts
- A GitHub repository for releases and documentation

Installation
- Clone the repository
- Install prerequisites as described in the docs (runtime, libraries, and tooling)
- Build the server component if needed
- Build or install the client tooling for end-user devices

Configuration
- License server: Configure the license store, binding rules, expiration policies, and auditing options
- Client: Provide server endpoints, allowed HWID bounds, and activation policies
- Security: Enable secure communications, rotate keys, and restrict data collection to what is necessary
- Logging: Set log levels and destinations for centralized auditing

Usage
- License issuance: Create a license tied to a specific HWID or range of HWIDs
- Activation: Bind a device and activate the license on first use
- Renewal: Extend license validity before expiration
- Revocation: Remove access if terms are breached or device is decommissioned
- Auditing: Review license usage, activation events, and revocation history

API Reference (CLI and SDK)
- CLI commands: 
  - init: Initialize the licensing environment
  - bind: Bind a device HWID to a license
  - activate: Activate a license on a device
  - renew: Renew an existing license
  - revoke: Revoke a license from a device
  - status: Check license and device status
- SDKs (if provided): 
  - Methods to query license state, bind HWIDs, and handle activation tokens
  - Event hooks for activation, renewal, and revocation
- Data formats: 
  - JSON for requests and responses
  - Logs in a structured, machine-readable format

Security and Privacy
- HWID handling: Collect only the minimum data needed to bind a license to a device. Use hashing and secure storage to protect identifiers.
- Data minimization: Avoid collecting unnecessary telemetry. Favor local processing where possible.
- Encryption: Use encryption for data at rest and in transit. Validate certificates and enforce secure ciphers.
- Access control: Enforce strict access controls on the license server and sensitive logs.
- Compliance: Align with applicable laws and platform terms. Obtain user consent where required.

Testing
- Unit tests for core logic (binding, activation, renewal, revocation)
- Integration tests for server-client interactions
- End-to-end tests for licensing workflows
- Security tests for data handling, encryption, and access controls

Development and Extensibility
- Modularity: Core licensing logic separates from storage and transport layers
- Plugins: Optional plugin system for integration with existing game server tooling
- Documentation: Clear docs for developers to extend or customize behavior
- Internationalization: Consider localizing messages and docs for broader use

Contributing
- Follow the project’s code style and contribution guidelines
- Submit issues with reproducible steps and expected behavior
- Propose enhancements via pull requests
- Respect licensing and privacy constraints in all contributions

Roadmap
- Improve multi-tenant licensing support
- Add more platform bindings and CI support
- Expand audit reporting with exportable dashboards
- Enhance user-facing error messages and recovery flows

FAQ
- Can I use HWID licensing for free-to-play settings?
  Yes, as long as it respects user privacy, consent, and platform terms.
- What data is stored?
  Only what is necessary to bind licensing to devices and to audit usage.
- How do I revoke a license?
  Use the revoke command or API endpoint to cease access for a device.
- Is offline activation supported?
  Where appropriate, design activation to work with secure offline channels.
